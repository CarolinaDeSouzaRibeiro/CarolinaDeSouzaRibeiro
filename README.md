With good academic performance and willingness to learn, I excel in my dedication and persistence towards problem-solving and development, as well as a couple of creative abilities, primarily in the form of 3D modelling and rendering.


**Inclusion Note:** I am a disabled person (Autism Spectrum Disorder, support level 1 as per ICD11-6A02.0) hoping for an opportunity to discover new experiences via practical knowledge, assisting the development and refinement of skills and good practices, in order to nurture my growth as a professional.
